# Waste-Segregation-Machine-Learning
The Waste Segregation Project is a comprehensive initiative aimed at automating waste classification and segregation into eight distinct categories: paper waste, leaf waste, e-waste, wood waste, plastic bags, and plastic bottles. 
By utilizing machine learning and deep learning algorithms, this project aims to revolutionize waste management practices and promote efficient recycling.
Multiple machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Extra Trees, were employed to classify waste items accurately. 
These algorithms were trained using a diverse dataset of labeled images representing each waste category. By learning patterns and extracting meaningful features from the images, the models achieved precise waste classification based on visual characteristics.
